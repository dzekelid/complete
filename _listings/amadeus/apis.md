  description: "Using the term parameter and given the start of any word in an airport's
    official name, a city name, or the start of an IATA code, this API provides the
    full name and IATA location code of the city or airport, for use in flight searches.
    Only major cities and civilian airports with several commercial flights per week
    are included by default. The response provides up to 20 possible matches, sorted
    by importance, in a JQuery UI Autocomplete compatible format. This sample implementation
    using JQuery UI may help. This API uses data from the OpenTravelData project.\n
    \nBy only using the country parameter, this API is also able to find all the IATA
    location codes associated with a country. Both term and country parameters can
    be used together to filter the results accordingly.          \n\nThe value returned
    is the IATA location code. The label returned is always in UTF-8 format, with
    the airport official name (which is often in the native language), in the format
    of English City Name (if not already included in the airport name)."
